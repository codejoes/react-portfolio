      <ul>
        <li>
          I am a retired Army officer, former Pennsylvania native, and current
          resident of Washington, DC. I am focused on developing my techinical
          acumen to become a javascript-enabled fullstack developer.
        </li>
        <li>
          In my freetime I like to enjoy videogames like Halo, Apex Legends, or
          Rocket League with friends, watching anime shows like One Piece, Spy x
          Family, or Hunter x Hunter, and playing disc golf, pickleball, and
          tennis.
